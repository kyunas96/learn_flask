Make sure models work and seed all data ✅
Create a check for a valid session token as middleware ✅
Create managers for the each model that will be responsible for
  dealing with the database sessions and creating instances of the
  corresponding models



create Validators for models:
- check to see if data adheres to SQL schema

create controllers:
- Users:
  • 
- Posts:
  • creating a post:
    - name_for_hash = filename + user.id
    - hashed_name = hash(name_for_hash)
    - check to see if the s3 bucket already contains the hashed_name
    - upload the image to s3 under hashed_name and upon completion get the 
    name of the file and attach it to the Post model to be created
